Note:
These files are all unstructured and its late and I dont feel like figuring out how to upload an entire folder to github right now so the hierarchy of the folders and files should be exactly this:
D:\
  PowerShellFIMLab
    baseline
    Fim
    SampleFiles
      a
      b
      c
      d
You can use whatever drive you want, whatever names you want for the folders/files, etc. So long as you go into the code and change the corresponding names you shouldn't have a problem.
